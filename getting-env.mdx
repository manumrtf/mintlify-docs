Obtain `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from Google:

3. Once the project is created, click on the project name and then on the `Credentials` tab on the left side of the screen.
4. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. On `application type` we will select **Web Application**, then give it any name you want to reference it.
5. Now we need to add the `JavaScript Authorized Origins`, click on "Add URI" and introduce the URL of your app, if you are using localhost on the default port it will be `http://localhost:3000`
6. Last thing would be add a `Authorized URI Redirects`, click on "Add URI" and introduce the URL of your app followed by **/api/auth/callback/google** so it would look like this `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
7. Now click on Add and it will show the `Client ID`  and the `Client Secret ID` so copy the values and paste it into the corresponding variables on the `.env` file.
