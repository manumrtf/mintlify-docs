```bash
git clone repo
```

### 2. Install dependencies

For a quick development, shipit use sqlite as database by default. To fill the database with the neccesary tables, run the following command:
```bash

Create a `.env` file in the root of the proyect and copy-paste the content from the `.env.example` file.
The file will look like this:
```bash

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=""
LOOPS_API_KEY=""

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""

```
