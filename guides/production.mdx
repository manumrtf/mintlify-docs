There are a few things that you need to have in consideration before deploying your project to production.

## Environment variables
### Stripe
By default, Stripe uses the test environment. The keys you generated earlier are test keys. To use the live environment, you need to replace the test keys with the live keys.
To do that, just disable stripe test mode, and generate a new set of keys.

You will also need to go to the Stripe Webhooks section, and add your production URL and listen for the following events:
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `charge.succeeded`
- `checkout.session.expired`
- `invoice.paid`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

Now replace the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable with one for production.

### Nex Auth
You will need to update the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to your production URL.
If you are using Vercel, you can completely remove the NEXTAUTH_URL variable, as Vercel will automatically set it for you.
You will also need to update the NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable to a secure random string.
You can generate a secure random string by running the following command if you are on a Unix-like system:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
If you are using Windows just go to
[This vercel generator website](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32)
and fill the env variable with the generated string.

## Oauth Settings
It's time to update the url's that you have set up in the OAuth providers. 
You will need to update the callback URL and the redirect URL to your production URL.
replace `http://localhost:3000` with your production URL.

## Update your production URL

go to `src/app_settings.ts` and update the `APP_DOMAIN` variable with your production URL like so:
```ts src/app_settings.ts
export const APP_DOMAIN = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'http://localhost:3000' : 'https://hereyourproductionurl.com';
```


## Deploy on Vercel
To deploy your project on Vercel, you need to have a Vercel account.

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Click on the `Add new` button and select project
3. Select the repository where your project is located in Github
4. Copy all the environment variables from your `.env` file
5. Open the Environment Variables section
6. Click on the `Key` input field and paste, this will fill all your environment variables (remember to replace the test keys with the live keys if necessary)
7. Click on the `Deploy` button
8. Wait for the deployment to finish

Your project is now live on Vercel.

Once your project is live on Vercel, you can go to `Settings` > `Domains` and add your custom domain.
