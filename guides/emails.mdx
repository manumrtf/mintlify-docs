shipit uses Resend to send emails. To configure your email settings, you need to create an account in Resend.
Then, go to domains and add a new domain. You will find the instructions to add the DNS records in your domain provider.

Once your domain is verified, go to API Keys and create a new key. Copy the key and fill the `RESEND_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

Lastly, go to `src/app_settings.ts` and fill the `EMAIL_FROM` with the email you want to send emails from.

For example, if the domain I configured is `mail.shipit.so` and I want to use customers as name, I will fill the `EMAIL_FROM` with
```ts src/app_settings.ts
export const EMAIL_FROM = "customers@mail.shipit.so"
```

Where `customers` is the name I want to use, you can use any name you want.


If you want to modify the email templates, you will find the email templates in `src/emails` folder. You can customize them as you want.
