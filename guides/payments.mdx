## Create the plans
Go to your stripe account and create a product with your plan name, for example `Basic Plan`. 
Set a name, ammount and if it's a recurring plan or not.

Click on the product you just created and go to the `Pricing section`.
There, copy the content of the `API_ID` field. should look something like this: `price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

Repeat the process for each plan you want to create.

## Adding subscriptions to your app

You just need to use the `RecurringCheckoutButton` that you can import from `@/components/store/checkout-button`

It only takes one prop, the `priceId` that you copied from the stripe dashboard.

```tsx
<RecurringCheckoutButton priceId={"price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}>Start now</RecurringCheckoutButton>
```

<Check>
That's all, that would take you to the stripe checkout page where the user can subscribe to the plan, and it will handle all the rest.
</Check>

If you want a pre-defined ui to show your different plans, you can use the `ProductCard` component like so:


```tsx
 <ProductCard
          title="Basic"
          price="$99"
          description="Best for small business owners, startups who needs landing page for their business."
          features={["Thing number 1", "Thing number 2", "Thing number 3"]}
          purchaseButton={<RecurringCheckoutButton priceId={"price_1PAAVxJ6IFM3omoTJ2kigCqW"}>Start now</RecurringCheckoutButton>}

        />
 ```
## Add one-time payments to your app

In the prisma schema, you will find this model:

```prisma
model OneTimeProduct {
  id              String @id @default(cuid())
  stripeProductId String @unique
  name            String
  users           User[]
}
```

There, you can add the one-time payment products you want to sell in your app.
To add them, you can use, for example, prisma studio, opening the terminal and running `npx prisma studio`.
Then going to the `OneTimeProduct` table and adding the products you want to sell.

Now, you just need to render a `OneTimeCheckoutButton` component, that you can import from `@/components/store/checkout-button`.

It takes two props, the `productId` and the `priceId` of the product. Both you can get from the stripe dashboard.

You can also use the pre-defined `ProductCard` component to show your products.

```tsx
  <ProductCard
          title="My Product"
          price="$199"
          description="Best for small business owners, startups who needs landing page for their business."
          features={["Thing number 1", "Thing number 2", "Thing number 3"]}
          purchaseButton={<OneTimeCheckoutButton priceId="price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" productId="prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx">Buy now</OneTimeCheckoutButton>}

        />
```

<Check>
You have now configured payments in your app.
