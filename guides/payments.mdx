## Create the plans
Go to your stripe account and create a product with your plan name, for example `Basic Plan`. 
Set a name, ammount and if it's a recurring plan or not.

Click on the product you just created and go to the `Pricing section`.
There, copy the content of the `API_ID` field. should look something like this: `price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

Repeat the process for each plan you want to create.

## Adding it to your app

open the `app_settings.ts` file located at the `src` folder and fill the `plans` array with the plans you just created.

Let's put as an example that I have 3 plans, `Basic`, `Standard` and `Premium`.

The basic and premium plans are recurring plans, while the standard plan is a one-time payment. The config would look like this:

```ts src/app_settings.ts
export const STORE_PLANS = [
  {
    title: "Basic",
    price: "$99",
    description:
      "Best for small business owners, startups who needs landing page for their business.",
    features: ["Thing number 1", "Thing number 2", "Thing number 3"],
    priceId: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    type: "recurring"
  },
  {
    title: "Standard",
    price: "$199",
    description:
      "Best for small business owners, startups who needs landing page for their business.",
    features: ["Thing number 1", "Thing number 2", "Thing number 3", "Thing number 4"],
    highlight: true,
    priceId: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    type: "one-time"

  },
  {
    title: "Premium",
    price: "$299",
    description:
      "Best for small business owners, startups who needs landing page for their business.",
    features: ["Thing number 1", "Thing number 2", "Thing number 3", "Thing number 4", "Thing number 5"],
    priceId: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    type: "recurring"

  },
];
```

That's it! Now you have your plans configured in your app. Navigate to the `/pricing` page and you should see your plans there.
